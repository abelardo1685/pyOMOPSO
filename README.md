# pyOMOPSO
PyOMOPSO code parallelized

The code works using ray core to parallelize the computation and movement of the different particles. 
In case you do not have installed this library use: pip install ray before starting with the code. Additional information can be found in: https://www.ray.io/ray-core

The code uses a simple three-dimensional competitive objective function to demonstrate the use of the algorithm.
For further details about the OMOPSO algorithm please refer to the papers shown within the code
